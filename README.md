# Bitvavo-Coin-Monitor
Bitvavo Coin Monitor

This will be a tool with which you can retrieve the prices of the e-coins on bitvavao.nl with a set time interval. This is a first setup and uses the public Bitvavo api.

It is created in Visual Studio 2019. It is a Winforms .net5 project.
When you compile the program and start it up for the first time, you must first check the options in options that you want to track.
Note, this is a first draft and certainly not ready yet, but the basics work.
